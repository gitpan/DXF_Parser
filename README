DXF::Parser is based on a DXF to Alias|Wavefront .obj convertor I wrote
quite some time ago.  I converted this utility into a module, so i could
support other output formats easily.

This is the first release of the DXF::Parser module.  Included are
two sample drivers, dxftoobj and dxftoofig.  dxftofig has problems
with scaling (since i dont know the dimensions of the drawing before
conversion).

Items on the TODO list:
	. better support for BLOCK/INSERT
	. color/attribute support during conversion
